# Noon-Pacific-Quieter (Chrome Extension)
Lowers the default volume on music website Noon Pacific

Noon Pacific is a great music service that releases a new playlist every Monday at noon, Pacific Time. Unfortunately, it seems to be significantly louder by default than the rest of the web, and volume defaults to max on every page reload. This extension allows you to configure a quieter volume which will be set on page load. It defaults to 10%.
